# gitlab_mirror
Script to mirror all your project from one gitlab instance to another

I had a problem to find solution to make mirroring for all my projects with the same group structure. That's worked for me.

SITUATION:
I have main gitlab repositories (over 200).

TASK:
Make backups with daily updates (commits, merges etc.) from main gitlab instance to our internal gitlab instance.
